# Data Sandbox

The aim here is to use the tools I've assembled from (mostly sentdex's) tutorials on data science, visualization, and machine learning, along with some datasets drawn from FiveThirtyEight, to have some fun and build some stuff.

So far we've done a Tarantino chart (strange: there appears to be an inverse correlation between deaths and curses. Run some ML!) and a Bechdel chart (passes/fails by year).

Other possibilities from FiveThirtyEight: Twitter, Bechdel test, weather history, college majors, *Love Actually* crossovers, murder counts by city, NCAA predictions.

## Built With:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Results of Bechdel vs. Ratings:

Critic | Bechdel Score | Rating
--- | --- | --- 
IMDB | Pass | 6.62 
IMDB | Fail | 6.86 
Rotten Tomatoes | Pass | 60.4 
Rotten Tomatoes | Fail | 62.5 
Metacritic | Pass | 58.8 
Metacritic | Fail | 69.5
